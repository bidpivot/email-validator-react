This is a basic react project that I used to test out some basic react hooks.

You CAN actually use this tool to find someone's email address.  

The way it works is:
1 - Type in the person's name and domain name, it will suggest around 50 different possible email address combinations.  
2 - Copy those addresses into the bcc of a new email in gmail.  
3 - Hover over each email with your mouse.  If the email is real, you will likely see a profile of the person you are trying to reach.

This repo is also useful if you want to test out a new package or demo something; you can use it it without having to build yet another to-do list.
